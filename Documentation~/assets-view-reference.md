### Table

The table of issues has the following columns. Use the [table controls](project-auditor-window-reference.md#table-controls) to configure how to organize and display the data.

|**Property**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Issue**|Summary of the issue. Right-click on the issue to open its relevant code file, or open the documentation where possible.|
|**Severity**|An estimate of the severity of the issue. Severity can be Major, Moderate, Minor, or Ignored.|
